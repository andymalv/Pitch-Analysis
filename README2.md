# Baseball Pitching Analysis

A directory of multiple projects working with baseball biomechanics data. 

## Description

The purpose of this repo is to show my ability to work with baseball biomechanics data from different sources, as well as to practice calculating inverse kinematics and dynamics.
The [Hawkeye](https://github.com/andymalv/Pitch-Analysis/tree/main/Hawkeye) directory uses data taken from a Hawkeye system in a stadium.
The [Lab](https://github.com/andymalv/Pitch-Analysis/tree/main/Lab) directory uses data taken in a lab setting, specifically from the [Driveline Open Biomechanics](https://github.com/drivelineresearch/openbiomechanics/tree/main) dataset.

## Acknowledgments

A big thanks to [Driveline](https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/) for putting the data up for public use.
Also [Open Biomechanics](https://www.openbiomechanics.org/) for archiving public biomechanics data sets.
