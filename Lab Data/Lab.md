# Lab Pitch Analysis

Analysis of baseball pitch data recorded in a laboratory setting, provided by [Driveline](https://github.com/drivelineresearch/openbiomechanics/tree/main).

## Description

A program, written in multiple languages, to intake and process kinematic and kinetic data, then output plots.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python
    - listed in 'requirements.txt'

### Executing program

As written, the code expects the data to be in .csv files in the current working directory. Change as needed.

## Current Work
* Python:
    - Import data
    - Calculate inverse kinetics

## Future Plans

* Add inverse kinetic analysis
* More translations
    - MATLAB
    - Julia
    - R
    - C/C++
